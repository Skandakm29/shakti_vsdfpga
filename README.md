## Design Style Explanation
The SoC follows a **monolithic design style**, where functionality is implemented directly in the top-level module (`mkSoc`) using:
- **Registers** (e.g., `clint_clint_msip` for timer interrupts).
- **FIFOs** (e.g., `fabric_xactors_to_slaves` for routing).
- **Rules** (e.g., `RL_clint_clint_increment_timer` for timer logic).

This differs from a **modular design**, where components like `clint` or `uart` would be instantiated as separate modules. Instead, the code uses naming conventions (e.g., `clint_*`, `uart_*`, `fabric_*`) to group related logic into **functional blocks**.

## Notes
1. **Active-Low Reset**: `RST_N` resets the system when pulled low.
2. **AXI Protocol**:
   - Follow the [AXI4-Lite specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0022/e/) for signal timing and handshaking.
   - Use `*valid`/`*ready` signals for flow control (e.g., `awvalid` and `awready`).
3. **Simulation Signals**:
   - `mv_end_simulation` is useful in testbenches to terminate simulations automatically.
   - Use `io_dump_get` to debug system state (registers, FIFOs, etc.).
